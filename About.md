# Welcome to Reid's Brain
_A possibly morbid blog about that state of Reid's brain._

## 2025-02-15 - First scan
So the big news is that I have brain cancer. How bad, progress et, is still unknown. This is the place where I'll be updating  for everyone.

This was the day Luisa noticed my balance issues while shovelling snow off the driveway and took me to Centenary hospital. From arriving in the driveway to being inside a CT-scanner was around Â½ hour. Excellent, speedy care when it is needed.

## 2025-02-25 - (First) Operation
Just ten days later they sawed my skull open and removed as much tumour as they could.

# Onboarding for Radiation
Today went to Princess Margaret hospital to get my radiation mask! Reminds me of old Bill Bixby Hulk show when he's in his rotating chair with targets.

# What I'm Up To
I've been spending my time really getting into AI in the meanwhile. My goal is to use it with voice eventually in order to remain productive and fulfilled as long as possible.

I'm taking courses, watching tons of YouTube and really thinking hard about buying an M3 Ultra Mac Studio :-D
