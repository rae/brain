# Welcome to Reid's Brain
_A possibly morbid blog about that state of Reid's brain._

## 2025-02-15 - First scan
So the big news is that I have brain cancer. How bad, progress et, is still unknown. This is the place where I'll be updating  for everyone.

This was the day Luisa noticed my balance issues while shovelling snow off the driveway and took me to Centenary hospital. From arriving in the driveway to being inside a CT-scanner was around Â½ hour. Excellent, speedy care when it is needed.

## 2025-02-25 - (First) Operation
Just ten days later they sawed my skull open and removed as much tumour as they could. Afterwards, I was stuck in hospital for a couple of weeks.

Luisa and I managed to come down with COVID at the hospital. I'm thankful I was quad-vaxxed. Overall it was super-mild for me and they have me Paxlovid and Remdesivir.

## 2025-03-02 - Back Home

Thanks to the COVID we had to stay away from Michael lafter I got home. But at this point (2025-03-15) we are all clear and living comfortably and normally.

## 2025-03-11 - Staple removal
Got all 28 staples removed from my skull today. It's incredible how little pain the whole operation thing has caused. I barely noticed it really.

# 2025-03-15 - Onboarding for Radiation
Today went to Princess Margaret hospital to get my radiation mask! Reminds me of old Bill Bixby Hulk show when he's in his rotating chair with targets.


# Meanwhile..

I've been spending my time really getting into AI in the meanwhile. My goal is to use it with voice eventually in order to remain productive and fulfilled as long as possible.

I'm taking courses, watching tons of YouTube and really thinking hard about buying an M3 Ultra Mac Studio :-D
